### Factorize all the numbers from 1 to 20

- 20 = 5-2^2
- 19
- 18 = 2-3^2
- 17
- 16 = 2^4
- 15 = 3-5
- 14 = 2-7
- 13
- 12 = 3-2^2
- 11
- 10 = 2-5
- 9 = 3^2
- 8 = 2^3
- 7
- 6 = 2-3
- 5
- 4 = 2^2
- 3
- 2
- 1


### Take the greatest power of each prime and muliply them

19 - 3^2 - 17 - 2^4 - 13 - 11 - 7 - 5 = 232792560

This works because if a number is divisible by 2^4 it is as well divisible by 2^3 and so on.
