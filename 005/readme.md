### Factorize all the numbers from 1 to 20

- 20 = 5x2^2
- 19
- 18 = 2x3^2
- 17
- 16 = 2^4
- 15 = 3x5
- 14 = 2x7
- 13
- 12 = 3x2^2
- 11
- 10 = 2x5
- 9 = 3^2
- 8 = 2^3
- 7
- 6 = 2x3
- 5
- 4 = 2^2
- 3
- 2
- 1


### Take the greatest power of each prime and muliply them

19 x 3^2 x 17 x 2^4 x 13 x 11 x 7 x 5 = 232792560

This works because if a number is divisible by 2^4 it is as well divisible by 2^3 and so on.
